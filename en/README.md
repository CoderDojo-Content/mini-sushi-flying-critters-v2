# Make some animated flying hippos! 

* Open a new Scratch project. Let's change that cat into something with wings. Click on the cat and go to the **Costumes** tab. Click the first icon under **New costume** to choose a costume from the library.   

* Find the _flying hippo_. There are two: select one of them and click **OK**. Then add another costume the same way, and select the other flying hippo. Delete the two cat costumes by clicking on the little **x**. ![](NewCostumesHippo.png)

### Code to make the hippo fly
* In the Sprites panel, click your sprite. Add the following scripts to your sprite:

  This code makes the wings flap

  These blocks make the hippo move around

  Click on the green flag to see your animation! 

* Youâ€™re just missing a background. In the bottom left corner, you'll see the Stage. Click the first icon under New Backdrop to choose one from the library. If you prefer, you can make your own background by clicking on the **paintbrush** icon instead. ![](NewBackdropSmaller.png)

* Let's make more things fly! Click on the **duplicate** icon next to the scissors and click your sprite. Now there are two of them! Duplicate it as many times as you like. You can use the **scissors** button to delete sprites. ![](ScratchDuplicateBtnCircled.png)

* Once you've duplicated the hippo, you can change the costumes on the new sprites if you want. Why not try drawing your own costumes? 

Top tip: you can **duplicate** a costume and change it a little bit to make the animation work. ![](CostumesDrawBees.png)
