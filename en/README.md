# Make some animated flying hippos! 

1. Open a new Scratch project. Let's change that cat into something with wings. Click on the cat and go to the **Costumes** tab. Click the first icon under **New costume** to choose a costume from the library.   

3. Find the _flying hippo_. There are two: select one of them and click **OK**. Then add another costume the same way, and select the other flying hippo. Delete the two cat costumes by clicking on the little **x**. ![](NewCostumesHippo.png)

## Code to make the hippo fly
In the Sprites panel, click your sprite. Add the following scripts to your sprite:

Click on the green flag to see your animation! 

8. Youâ€™re just missing a background. In the bottom left corner, you'll see the Stage. click the first icon under New Backdrop to choose one from the library. If you prefer, you can make your own background. To do this, click on the **paintbrush** icon instead. ![](NewBackdropSmaller.png)
    * To delete a backdrop, click on the **scissors** icon at the top of the screen and click the backdrop you want to delete.

9. Let's make more things fly! Click on the **duplicate** icon next to the scissors and click your sprite. Now there are two of them! Duplicate it as many times as you like. You can use the **scissors** button to delete sprites. ![](ScratchDuplicateBtnCircled.png)

10. Once you've duplicated the hippo, you can change the costumes on the new sprites if you want. Why not try drawing your own costumes? 

Top tip: you can **duplicate** a costume and change it a little bit to make the animation work. ![](CostumesDrawBees.png)
