### Make more things fly!
* Right-click on your sprite and select **duplicate**. Now there are two of them! Duplicate it as many times as you like. You can use the **delete** option to delete sprites.

* Once you've duplicated the hippo sprite, change the costumes of the new sprite. If you want you could even try drawing costumes of your own!

  Top tip: you can **duplicate** a costume too! Doing this makes it easy to create two costumes that are nearly the same.
