  Click on the green flag to see your animation! 

### Add a background
* In the bottom right-hand corner, you'll see the **Stage**. Click the icon to **Choose a Backdrop** from the library. If you prefer, you can draw your own background by then selecting the **paintbrush** icon.

### Make more things fly!
* Right-click on your sprite and select **duplicate**. Now there are two of them! Duplicate it as many times as you like. You can use the **delete** option to delete sprites.

* Once you've duplicated the hippo, you can change the costumes on the new sprite if you want. Why not try drawing your own costumes?

  Top tip: you can **duplicate** a costume too! This makes it easy to draw two that are nearly the same.
